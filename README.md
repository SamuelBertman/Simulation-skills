## 1. Learn DFT (Density Functional Theory) basics  
### What to do:  
- Start with introductory theory: Understand what DFT is and why it’s used in materials chemistry.  
- Take the **MITx: Atomistic Modeling of Materials** course modules on DFT.  
- Supplement with **NanoHub.org DFT courses** for practical examples.  

### Tools to practice:  
- If possible, get access to **VASP** and run simple DFT calculations on basic molecules/materials.  
- Use **Materials Project API** to explore computed material properties.

### How to show progress:  
- Upload your course certificates or notes.  
- Share example input files and output summaries from VASP or Materials Project API queries on GitHub.  
- Write a short blog post explaining DFT in your own words, with simple examples.

## 2. Learn Molecular Dynamics (MD)  
### What to do:  
- Learn MD basics from the **NanoHub.org MD simulations courses** and relevant MITx modules.  
- Study the theory behind atomic motion and how MD simulates materials over time.  

### Tools to practice:  
- Set up and run basic MD simulations with **LAMMPS** and **ASE** (Atomic Simulation Environment).  
- Start with simple polymer chain simulations or small composites.

### How to show progress:  
- Upload your MD simulation scripts and visualizations to GitHub.  
- Document key results or animations showing molecular movement.  
- Write a blog section on MD’s role in modeling polymer healing behavior.

## 3. Learn Finite Element Analysis (FEA)  
### What to do:  
- Complete relevant modules in **Coursera: Materials Science** course to understand macroscopic modeling.  
- Learn basic FEA concepts, meshing, and how it applies to composites.

### Tools to practice:  
- Use **COMSOL Multiphysics** or **MATLAB** to build simple models simulating stress or heat flow in polymers.  
- Model a hypothetical damaged polymer patch and simulate healing effects.

### How to show progress:  
- Share COMSOL/MATLAB files with documentation.  
- Include plots/diagrams of stress distribution or heat transfer before and after healing.  
- Create a blog post explaining the FEA results and their significance.

## General Tips to Track and Showcase Your Learning:

- Maintain a **GitHub repo** organized by concept (e.g., `/DFT`, `/MD`, `/FEA`) containing code, data, and notes.  
- Regularly write **short summaries or blog posts** reflecting what you learned and how it ties into your project.  
- Make **visual diagrams or animations** illustrating your simulations and concepts.  
- Create a **final presentation or video summary** combining all three topics showing your integrated understanding.
